# Recursive-Descent-Arithmetic-Parser

I made this project for my CSCI 4200 - Programming Languages course.

It is a basic front-end for a compiler, consisting of:
* A **lexical analyzer** written in C++.
* A **recursive-descent parser** also written in C++.

It is designed to process simple arithmetic expressions.

### Example Expression
```
PROGRAM
	sumTotal = (sum + 47    ) / total;
	area = (length + width) / 2;
	ageNumbers = age + 3 - 5 * (D / C);
	Total = (sum + 47    ) /;
END
```
